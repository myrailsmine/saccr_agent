#### **New Navigation Features:**

**üìã Phase Categories:**
- üìä Data & Classification (Steps 1-4)
- ‚öôÔ∏è Risk Calculations (Steps 5-10)  
- üìà Add-On Aggregation (Steps 11-13)
- üéØ PFE Calculation (Steps 14-16)
- üí∏ Replacement Cost (Steps 17-18)
- üè¶ Final EAD & Capital (Steps 19-24)

**üöÄ Quick Navigation Buttons:**
- Instant access to any phase

- One-click phase switching

## üéØ User Experience Improvements

### **Before Enhancement:**
- AI Assistant provided only text responses
- Dropdown navigation caused screen resets
- Limited analysis depth in AI responses
- Frustrating user experience with navigation

### **After Enhancement:**
- AI Assistant provides same rich format as main calculator
- Smooth, persistent navigation between calculation phases
- Comprehensive dashboard-style AI responses
- Professional, uninterrupted user experience

## üîß Technical Implementation

### **Session State Management:**
```python
# Persistent dropdown selection
if 'selected_step_category' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.selected_step_category = "üìä Data & Classification (1-4)"

# Calculation results preservation
st.session_state.current_result = result
st.session_state.current_netting_set = netting_set
```

### **AI Format Detection:**
```python
# Smart question categorization
calculation_keywords = ['calculate', 'analysis', 'result', 'breakdown', 'step', 'formula', 'ead', 'rwa', 'capital', 'pfe', 'replacement cost']
is_calculation_query = any(keyword in question.lower() for keyword in calculation_keywords)

# Enhanced format trigger
if is_calculation_query and has_calculation_data:
    display_ai_enhanced_analysis(question)
```

### **Navigation Enhancement:**
```python
# Quick navigation buttons
for i, (category_name, steps) in enumerate(step_categories.items()):
    if st.button(category_short, key=f"nav_btn_{i}"):
        st.session_state.selected_step_category = category_name
        st.rerun()
```
