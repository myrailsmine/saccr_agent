üß† THINKING PROCESS:
The user is asking about capital optimization for derivatives, which is a complex topic requiring portfolio-specific analysis. Without current calculation context, I need to gather key information to provide meaningful guidance.

üìã REGULATORY ANALYSIS:
Under Basel SA-CCR, capital requirements are driven by Exposure at Default (EAD), which consists of Replacement Cost (RC) and Potential Future Exposure (PFE). Key optimization levers include netting agreements, collateral management, and portfolio composition.

üéØ PRACTICAL GUIDANCE:
To provide specific optimization recommendations, I need:
1. Current portfolio composition and SA-CCR calculation results
2. Existing netting and collateral agreements
3. Business constraints and risk appetite

‚ö†Ô∏è ASSUMPTIONS:
Proceeding with general optimization strategies applicable to most derivatives portfolios.

üß† THINKING PROCESS:
Analyzing the specific PFE calculation for this portfolio. PFE = Multiplier √ó Aggregate AddOn. Looking at the calculation steps to identify the key drivers.

üìä QUANTITATIVE IMPACT:
Your PFE of $X is driven by:
- Adjusted Notional: $500M
- Supervisory Factor: 0.5% for USD Interest Rate
- Maturity Factor: Based on 3-year remaining maturity
- Asset Class Correlation: Single asset class (100% correlation)

üéØ PRACTICAL GUIDANCE:
High PFE indicates significant future exposure risk. Optimization options:
1. Implement margining to reduce maturity factor
2. Consider portfolio netting with offsetting positions
3. Review supervisory delta calculations
